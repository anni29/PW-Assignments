    "                A for loop is a control flow statement that executes code repeatedly for a \n",
    "                particular number of iterations. In this control flow statement, the keyword used is for. \n",
    "                The for loop is used when the number of iterations is already known.\n",
    "\n",
    "                The for loop has two parts:\n",
